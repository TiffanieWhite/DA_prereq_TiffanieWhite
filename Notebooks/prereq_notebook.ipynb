    "<h1> Hello Everyone!! My name is Tiffanie White.\n",
    "<p1> Hello everyone and thank you for the opportunity to continue this life changing opportunity with Code You. I plan to learn any and everything I can (once I am able to discern what all that is) to make a better life for my boys and myself. I have three son's (two of them are asperger autistic). I work full time remotely from home with a pharmaceutical company. I don't have much down time, but currently I have been trying to spend as much time as I can over the phone or in person with my dad who went into the hospital almost three weeks ago with severe sepsis and necrotizing fascitis. I look forward to everything with Code You and hope to be in a much better place careerwise and family wise by this time next year. <p1>"
